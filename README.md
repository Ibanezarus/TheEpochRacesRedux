Bet on horses that compete in predetermined races, forever...

After working on another project, i was fascinated about learning of Epoch or Unix time. I started wondering of other ways to play with it and decided to create a horse racing game in Python where every 5 minutes, the horses race and progres more by a siple algorithm based on the time in epoch seconds. It's a silly idea, but I thought it was interesting to think about horses who's fates are already determined. If you use the simple algorithm to look ahead, you could essentially win everytime. 

Anyway, hope you think it's neat, however trivial it may seem.
